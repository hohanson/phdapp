1. [Skin in the game: College's financial incentives and student outcomes](https://github.com/hohanson/documents/blob/main/skiningame.pdf)

Abstract: This paper studies how schools respond to financial incentives. Governments can penalize institutions with high dropout or loan default rates, and these institutions can respond by increasing quality or changing the selection of students. We build an equilibrium model to illustrate the trade-off faced by policymakers. We study the predictions of the model using a 2017 reform in Brazil, which made schools pay a fee for students receiving federal student loans that dropped out or defaulted. Consistent with the predictions of the model, we find that schools more reliant on government aid reduced dropout rates, primarily by increasing quality.

1. Optimal education subsidy and income tax with incomplete markets (master's thesis)

Abstract: This paper studies the optimal coverage of college education. Considers a social planner who decides who attends college and who pays tax to finance the budget. Sending students to college increases their wages and hence welfare. But increasing college attendance reduces the equilibrium wage and the overall return. Financing the budget through taxation also causes welfare loss. Because of these trade-offs, only students with a sufficiently high return to education should attend college. This paper explores these trade-offs using an overlapping generations model, and determines the optimal coverage of college education and the corresponding tax structure.
